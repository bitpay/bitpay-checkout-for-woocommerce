Try out our brand new plugin for Woocommerce. Accept cryptocurrency payments through BitPay on your WooCommerce store and get paid via bank transfers

== Description ==

== BitPay Payment Gateway plugin for WooCommerce ==

= Key features =

* accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash payments from payment protocol compatible wallets
* Price in your local currency
* Get settled via Bank transfer (EUR, USD, GBP or any of the supported [fiat currencies](https://bitpay.com/docs/settlement)), BTC, BCH or stable coins (GUSD, USDC)
* By design, chargebacks are not possible with cryptocurrency payments
* Have an overview of all your bitcoin and bitcoin cash payments in your BitPay merchant account at https://bitpay.com/dashboard
* Refund your customers in bitcoin or bitcoin cash in your BitPay merchant dashboard at https://bitpay.com/dashboard/payments

= Customer journey =

1. The customer is adding items to his shopping card and proceeds to checkout - the total amount is $100 USD.
2. The customer selects BitPay as checkout method.
3. A BitPay invoice is generated, the customer selects one of the supported cryptocurrency to complete the payment. The invoice will display an amount to pay in the selected cryptocurrency, at an exchange rate locked for 15 minutes.
4. The customer completes the payment using a compatible wallet within the 15 min window.
5. Once the transaction is fully confirmed on the blockchain, BitPay notifies the merchant and the corresponding amount is credited to the BitPay merchant account minus our 1% processing fee - thus $99 USD in this example.

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* This plugin requires [Woocommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).
* A BitPay merchant account ([Test](http://test.bitpay.com) and [Production](http://www.bitpay.com))

NOTE: If you were using a previous version of this plugin, this version (3.0) was completely rewritten to improve the user experience and the security.

= Plugin installation =

1. Get started by signing up for a [BitPay merchant account](https://bitpay.com/dashboard/signup)
2. Look for the BitPay plugin via the [Wordpress Plugin Manager](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins_Add_New_Screen). From your Wordpress admin panel, go to Plugins > Add New > Search plugins and type **BitPay**
3. Select **BitPay for Woocommerce** and click on **Install Now** and then on **Activate Plugin**

After the plugin is activated, BitPay will appear in the WooCommerce>Payments section.

= Plugin configuration =

After you have installed the BitPay plugin, the configuration steps are:

1. Create an API token from your BitPay merchant dashboard:
	* Login to your BitPay merchant account and go to the [API token settings](https://bitpay.com/dashboard/merchant/api-tokens)
	* click on the **Add new token** button: indicate a token label (for instance: Woocommerce), uncheck "Require Authentication" and click on the **Add Token** button
	* Copy the token value
2. Log in to your WordPress admin panel, select Woocommerce > Payments and click on the **Set up** button next to the BitPay Payment methods
	* Paste the token value into the appropriate field: **Development Token** for token copied from the sandbox environment (test.bitpay.com) and **Production Token** for token copied from the live environment (bitpay.com)
	* select the endpoint - Test or Production
	* Click "Save changes" at the bottom of the page

= Order fulfilment =
	
This plugin also includes an IPN (Instant Payment Notification) endpoint that will update your WooCommerce order status. An order note will automatically be added with a link to the BitPay invoice *(will open in a new window)*:

* When the customer initiates a transaction from his wallet to pay the BitPay invoice, the status of the Woocommerce order will change to **Processing**
* When the transaction is confirmed by BitPay, the status of the Woocommerce order will change to **Completed**. The order will be safe to ship, allow access to downloadable products, etc.
* If a bitpay invoice expires before the customer completed the payment, the Woocommerce order will change to **Cancelled**.
* If you refund a BitPay invoice from your BitPay merchant dashboard, the Woocommerce order will change to **Refunded** once the refund is processed by BitPay.
